# Rain in Australia


The goal of the project was to build a predictive model for forecasting rainy days in Australia. The model was trained using meteorological data provided by the dataset and is able to predict whether or not there will be rain the next day. A logistic regressor (Logit) was used as the model through the python statsmodels library.

At the state of the art, the model predicts with 85% accuracy whether there will be rain or not the next day (binary regression).

In addition, time series analyses were performed regarding some numerical features of the dataset using the Vector Autoregression (VAR) technique.

The public dataset "Rain in Australia" available on Kaggle was used. (https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).
